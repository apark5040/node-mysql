# node-mysql

### Overview

This is a homework that incorporates node with SQL. It uses the same tables with preset values and has different `.js` files that has different functions. 


### Instructions

1.) Use the code in `bamazon.sql` to create a new database with a table. This will create a table called `products` and populate it with 10 different rows. 

2.) Once you have cloned the repo, go to the folder in your terminal and run `npm i` to unpackage the `package.json`. This will install `inquirer` and `mysql` npm package which is required to run the node files. 

3.) To run one of the files, type in `node ***INSERT .JS FILE NAME HERE***`
